## Allow Me to Reintroduce Myself
This project is the second iteration of my online portfolio. This time around, I wanted to venture into the New Modern Web by utilizing JAMstack architecture, the GatsbyJS ecosystem as well as CSS in JS with Styled Components. 

In the end, I found that I was left with an incredibly fast and reliable site with improved scalability and security. It was a great first foray into the JAMstack workflow and I'm excited to dive deeper and build more things.

## Next Steps

Now that basic functionality is complete, I'm working towards taking the project to the next level by adding:

- [] Testing with Jest
